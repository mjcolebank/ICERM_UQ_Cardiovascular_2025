Project 0: Contains a variety of code implementations for different methods.

Project 1: Cardiac Code:

Objective:
Explore and experiment with an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) model.

Active Subspace Method

Overview:
This method maps a set of input parameters (p total) to an output quantity of interest (e.g., a measurement).

- Construct a matrix representing this input-output relationship.
- Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant directions in the input space.
- The resulting C matrix is symmetric, meaning it shares dimensions with its eigenbasis—an elegant mathematical feature.
- The dominant directions identified through this process are known as Active Subspaces.
- Using the active subspace method often leads to a form of polynomial regression over the reduced subspace.

Open Questions & Thoughts

- Temporal Variation:
  What happens if the system dynamics change over time?
  → This could result in different active subspaces at different time points.

- Multiple Time Points:
  Can we evaluate changes in stability or behavior using tools like the Lyapunov exponent?
  → Possibly by analyzing the evolution of a sequence of transformation matrices over time.

- Alternative Matrix Analysis:
  What insights might we gain by analyzing other matrices in the system?
  → For example, exploring the singular vectors of different components could reveal new structural properties.

** Post Lunch

Spring Problem:

* We are looking at the case that we have multiple important parameters. 
* Our ACTIVE subspaces have each of the parameters.
